DESCRIPTION: email_gen_send_dataset - task_progression Analysis
==================================================
Analysis for scorer: task_progression
Scorer Name: Task Progression
Reasoning:
Based on the lower-scored samples, the agent is failing for the following reasons:
*   **Lacks Detail and Context:** The agent's responses lack sufficient detail to fully assess task completion. The overall goal of the task is often not explicitly defined in the agent's process, making it difficult to evaluate the final output.
*   **Vague Information:** The agent provides vague information, such as using an "Unnamed API," which obscures the process and hinders a full evaluation of its actions.
*   **Incomplete Output Description:** While the agent indicates it has sent an email, it fails to provide details about the email's content beyond the subject and recipients. This makes it impossible to judge the quality and relevance of the report it generated.

DESCRIPTION: email_gen_send_dataset - context_relevancy Analysis
==================================================
Analysis for scorer: context_relevancy
Scorer Name: context_relevancy
Reasoning:
*   The agent's response lacks detail and context regarding the content of the generated files and emails. It confirms an action was completed but does not provide a summary or specifics of the data within the report or message.
*   The output is missing information about the input data that was processed, making it difficult to fully assess task completion and understanding.
*   The agent's responses can lack clarity, for instance, by referencing an "Unnamed API" or using cryptic subject lines.
*   The agent occasionally includes unprofessional elements, such as emojis, in its output.
