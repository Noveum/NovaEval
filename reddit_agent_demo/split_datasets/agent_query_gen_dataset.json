Based on the \"Unnamed API\" title and the lack of details, I will assume the API is a generic, simple, and unspecialized service for basic data storage and retrieval (e.g., a simple key-value or JSON store). Here are 5 search queries for such a service: *   Is there a dead-simple API out there just for storing and retrieving JSON blobs? I don't need a complex database. *   What's the easiest way to mock a backend with simple CRUD for a front-end prototype I'm building? *   I'm making a small hobby app and need to store some basic user settings. What's the best way to do this without spinning up a full database?"
