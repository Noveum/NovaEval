No concrete progress was made towards the goal.","The response accurately reflects a server error encountered while accessing the API.  It's relevant to the task and appropriately formatted. However, it lacks proactive suggestions (e.g., retry mechanisms or alternative approaches) which would improve its helpfulness and score.","The agent's response indicates a failure to access the target URL, resulting in a server error.  No tools were used. While this isn't inherently a role violation, it fails to complete the assigned task, demonstrating a significant deviation from the expected outcome. The lack of any attempt to address the error further reduces the score.",Error: Missing required fields,Error: Missing required fields
