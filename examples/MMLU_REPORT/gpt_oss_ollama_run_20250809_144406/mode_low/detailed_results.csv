The company plans to send out an e-mail survey to a sample of current customers with a link that gives participants a month of streaming service for free once the survey has been completed. They know that musical tastes vary by geographical region. Which of the following sample plans would produce the most representative sample of its customers?
A. Choose all of the customers who joined in the last month.
B. Make a list of all the customers who joined in the last 12 months and choose a random sample of customers on this list.
C. From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the state in which they live, then choose 10 customers from each state.
D. From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the state in which they live, then choose 3% of the customers from each state.
Answer:","From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the state in which they live, then choose 3% of the customers from each state.","The best choice is **D.**
By stratifying the sample by state and then taking a proportion (3%) of customers from each state, the sample will reflect the geographic distribution of the entire customer base. This approach controls for the known variation in musical tastes across regions and avoids the bias that would come from simply selecting a fixed number of customers per state or from a subset of the newest customers.

Plan II samples only the 132 students who are known to invest.

Answer:",127 points,"First find the student’s z‑score on the midterm:

\[
z = \frac{58-52}{4} = \frac{6}{4}=1.5

The same z‑score on the final exam gives

A. 27
B. 64
C. 106
D. 423
Answer:",423,"For a proportion \(p\) with an unknown value, the worst‑case variance is \(p(1-p)=0.5\times0.5=0.25\).

Answer:",I and II,"Power of a hypothesis test is \(1-\beta\) (the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis).

A. 1.06
B. 0.1446
C. 0.2275
D. 0.8554
Answer:",0.1446,"**Answer: B. 0.1446**

**Explanation**

We test

\[
H_0: p = 0.30 \qquad\text{vs}\qquad H_A: p > 0.30
\]

Using the normal approximation to the binomial, the test statistic is

\[
z = \frac{\hat p - p_0}
        {\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)/n}}
      = \frac{0.35-0.30}
            {\sqrt{0.30(1-0.30)/95}}
      = \frac{0.05}{\sqrt{0.21/95}}
      = \frac{0.05}{0.0470}
      \approx 1.062 .
\]

Because the alternative is one–sided ( \(p>0.30\) ), the P‑value is the probability of observing a \(z\)-value at least as large as 1.062 under the null:

\[
\text{P‑value} = P(Z \ge 1.062) = 1 - \Phi(1.062) .
\]

From standard normal tables or a calculator:

\[
\Phi(1.062) \approx 0.8554
\]
\[
\text{P‑value} = 1 - 0.8554 = 0.1446 .
\]

Hence the correct P‑value is **0.1446**.",1.0

What is the probability that Ben asks Charlene to the prom?
A. 0.78
B. 0.3
C. 0.24
D. 0.48
Answer:",0.3,"Let

- \(A\) = “Alfred asks Charlene”,
- \(B\) = “Ben asks Charlene”.

We know

\[
P(A)=0.6,\qquad P(A\cap B)=0.18,\qquad P(A\cup B)=0.72 .
\]

Use the inclusion–exclusion formula for the union of two events:

\[
P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B).
\]

Insert the known values:

\[
0.72 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.18.
\]

Solve for \(P(B)\):

\[
0.72 = 0.42 + P(B) \quad\Longrightarrow\quad P(B)=0.72-0.42=0.30.

Some students feel that this dress code unfairly targets female students.

They find that 66 females oppose the dress code and 50 males oppose the dress code. Which of the following explains why a two-proportion z-test is not appropriate?
A. The sample sizes are different.
B. The sample sizes are too large.
C. The number of successes and the number of failures for the two groups are not all large enough.
D. The shapes of the population distributions are not known.
Answer:",The number of successes and the number of failures for the two groups are not all large enough.,"The two‑proportion \(z\)-test relies on the normal approximation to the binomial.
That approximation is only valid when both the number of “successes” and the number of “failures” are at least about 10 in each sample:

For the male students
\(n=60,\; p = 50/60 \approx 0.833\), giving \(n(1-p)=60(0.167)\approx 10\) (just at the threshold).

Because the female group does not meet the required minimum number of failures, the normal approximation is not justified.

A. 30 times for each game

Answer:",300 times for the first game and 30 times for the second,"**Answer: C. 30 times for the first game and 300 times for the second**

**Why**

| Game | Goal | 30 flips | 300 flips |

For the first game you get a much larger chance of hitting the “sweet‑spot” window when you flip 300 times.

About 98% of the variation in the response variable can be explained by the regression on the explanatory variable.

Explanation
- **R‑squared = 98.1 %** means that about 98 % of the variation in the response variable is accounted for by the linear regression model.
- A high R‑squared indicates a *strong* linear relationship, but the direction (positive or negative) depends on the sign of the estimated slope, which is not specified in the question. Therefore either a strong positive or a strong negative relationship could be true, but not both simultaneously.
- Consequently, statements **I** and **II** are *not both* necessarily true; only one of them could be correct depending on the sign of the slope. Statement **III** is unequivocally true.

A. For every year the car gets older, the selling price goes down by approximately 9.83 percent.
B. A new car costs on the average $9,830.
C. For every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $1,590.
D. For every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $983.
Answer:","For every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $983.","The regression equation is
