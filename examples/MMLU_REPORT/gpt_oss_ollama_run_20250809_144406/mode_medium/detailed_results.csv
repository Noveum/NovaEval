During the actual vote, not all eligible voters voted, but 56 percent of the respondents voted against the annexation. Which of the following best describes the difference in the percentages obtained from the newspaper poll and the vote itself?
A. It is an example of nonresponse bias, the systematic tendency of individuals with particular characteristics to refuse to answer a survey question.

Answer:","This is a stratified sample, which may give comparative information that a simple random sample wouldn't give.","**Answer: D – This is a stratified sample, which may give comparative information that a simple random sample wouldn't give.**

**Why?**

* **Stratified sampling** – The population is divided into non‑overlapping groups (strata) that are relatively homogeneous within each group but differ between groups. The researcher then draws a random sample from each stratum.
  * In this case, the strata are the 125 school districts.
  * From each district, a random sample of principals is drawn.
  * This ensures that every district is represented in the sample, and it allows comparisons across districts that would not be possible with a simple random sample.

* **Cluster sampling** – Would involve randomly selecting a subset of districts and then taking all principals in those selected districts (or a random sample within each selected district). That is not what is described.

* **Systematic sampling** – Involves selecting every *k*‑th element from a list; the method described uses random sampling within each district, not systematic selection.

* **Simple random sampling** – Treats the entire list of all principals in the state as one population and draws a single random sample. That would ignore the district structure and might miss important variation between districts.

* \(R\) = room and board, \(\sigma_R = 380\)

**Why this is the right answer**

- In inference about a population mean, we usually do not know the true population standard deviation, σ.
- We estimate σ with the sample standard deviation, \(s\).
- Substituting \(s\) for σ introduces extra uncertainty (the estimate \(s\) varies from sample to sample).
- The resulting sampling distribution of \(\bar{X}\) is no longer exactly normal; it has heavier tails.
- The **t‑distribution** accounts for this additional variability, and it converges to the normal distribution as the sample size becomes large (by the Central Limit Theorem).

Thus, we use the t‑distribution for mean‑inference procedures when σ is unknown and must be estimated from the data.",1.0

If the pool is very large relative to 12, one can approximate the selection as independent Bernoulli trials with probability \(p = 0.30\) of picking a woman (a binomial model). In that case the probability would be

\[
P(\text{at least 3 women}) = 1-\Big[P(0)+P(1)+P(2)\Big]
=1-\Big[0.7^{12}+12(0.3)(0.7)^{11}+66(0.3)^2(0.7)^{10}\Big]\approx 0.75 .
\]

However, if the jury pool is not very large, the correct model is the hypergeometric distribution:

\[
P(\text{at least 3 women})=\sum_{k=3}^{12}\frac{\binom{W}{k}\binom{N-W}{12-k}}{\binom{N}{12}},
\]

where \(N\) is the total number of potential jurors and \(W=0.30N\) is the number of women.

How many students should be sampled to get a 90 percent confidence interval with a width of at most 0.08?
A. 27
B. 64
C. 106
D. 423
Answer:",423,"For a proportion the 90 % confidence interval is

\[
\hat p \;\pm\; z_{\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{\hat p(1-\hat p)}{n}}
\]

The total width of the interval must be at most \(0.08\), so the half‑width (margin of error) is

\[
E = \frac{0.08}{2}=0.04 .
\]

The 90 % confidence level gives \(z_{\alpha/2}=z_{0.95}=1.645\).

Because the true proportion \(p\) is unknown, we use the conservative value \(p=0.5\) (which maximizes \(p(1-p)\)) to guarantee the required precision for any actual proportion.

\[
n \;=\; \frac{z_{\alpha/2}^{\,2}\,p(1-p)}{E^{2}}
      = \frac{(1.645)^{2}\,(0.5)(0.5)}{(0.04)^{2}}

B. Whether to use a one- or a two-sided test is typically decided after the data are gathered.

The power of a hypothesis test is defined as the probability that the test correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. In other words, it measures the test’s ability to detect an effect (or alternative) when it actually exists. The other statements are incorrect:

- **A** is false because a rejection at the 10% level does *not* guarantee a rejection at the 5% level (e.g., a p‑value of 0.08 is significant at 10% but not at 5%).
- **B** is false; the choice between a one‑sided and two‑sided test should be made *before* collecting data, based on research questions and prior theory.

D. For every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $983.
Answer:","For every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $983.","The regression gives the **average** selling price (in thousands of dollars) as a function of age:

\[
\text{Selling price (thousands)} = 15.9 - 0.983\;(\text{age}).

D. The sample proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval.
Answer:",The sample proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval.,"**Answer: C**

**Why C is the correct statement**

A 95 % confidence interval for a proportion is constructed so that, if we were to repeat the sampling procedure many times, **approximately 95 % of the intervals that we would compute would contain the true population proportion**.
That is the formal interpretation of “95 % confidence”: the interval is not guaranteed to contain the true proportion in this particular sample, but it has a 95 % chance (over repeated samples) of doing so.

**Why the other statements are not necessarily true**

| Statement | Why it’s not necessarily true |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| **A.** “The true proportion … is within the confidence interval constructed.” | The interval is built from one sample; it is *not* certain that the true proportion lies inside it. Only the long‑run coverage probability is 95 %. |
| **B.** “Ninety‑five percent of students … have the correct address.” | The confidence level (95 %) is a property of the sampling procedure, not of the actual proportion in the population. |
| **D.** “The sample proportion … is within the confidence interval.” | Although a confidence interval is centered on the sample proportion, the question’s wording is about what *must* be true. The key concept that must be true in the context of a confidence interval is its coverage property (statement C). The inclusion of the sample proportion is a construction detail and is not what the question is testing. |
