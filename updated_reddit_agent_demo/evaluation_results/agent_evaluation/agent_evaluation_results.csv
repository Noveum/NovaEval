However, the 'HTTPError' suggests a failure in the tool's execution. This signifies minimal progress, as the intended function wasn't successfully performed. While the intent is there, the error prevents concrete advancement toward the goal. ","The agent's response provides a specific error message related to an API call, which is relevant to a tool call attempting to fetch search results. The error message aligns with the role of a tool that executes programmed functions. The response is helpful in indicating a problem, though lacks context for a higher score.","The agent fails to execute the tool call as expected, instead returning an HTTP error. This completely contradicts the assigned role and task. The agent does not function as intended, showing no adherence.

It aligns with the tool role's expectation of reporting results, even if it's an error. The error message is clear. Minor improvements could involve error handling details.","The agent's response indicates an HTTP error, which directly contradicts the expectation of a functional tool call.
