Since the denominators are the same (14), we can add the numerators directly:

A. 2
B. 3
C. 5
D. 12
Answer:",5,"Let's analyze the seating arrangement step-by-step.

There are 7 desks arranged in a row, numbered from left to right as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

- Kim sits at some desk \( k \).
- Hector sits 2 seats to the right of Kim, so Hector sits at desk \( k + 2 \).
- Tonya sits 3 seats to the right of Hector, so Tonya sits at desk \( k + 2 + 3 = k + 5 \).

Since there are only 7 seats:

\[
k + 5 \leq 7 \implies k \leq 2
\]

So Kim can sit at seat 1 or seat 2.

- If Kim sits at 1:
  - Hector sits at \(1 + 2 = 3\)
  - Tonya sits at \(3 + 3 = 6\)

- If Kim sits at 2:
  - Hector sits at \(2 + 2 = 4\)
  - Tonya sits at \(4 + 3 = 7\)

Now, the question is: How many seats to the left of Tonya does Kim sit?

- In scenario 1: Tonya at 6, Kim at 1
  Number of seats to the left of Tonya that Kim sits = \(6 - 1 = 5\)

- In scenario 2: Tonya at 7, Kim at 2
  Number of seats to the left of Tonya that Kim sits = \(7 - 2 = 5\)

In both cases, the answer is 5.
