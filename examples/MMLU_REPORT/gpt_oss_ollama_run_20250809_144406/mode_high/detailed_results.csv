Fifteen engineers work in the Atlanta office, and 14 engineers work in the New Orleans office. The business manager decided to use a 2-sample t-test to compare the mean salaries of engineers in the two offices. Because there were only 15 engineers in one office and 14 engineers in the other, he used the salaries of all the engineers in the computation. Is the 2-sample t-test an appropriate inferential technique in this situation?
A. Yes, because he is comparing the means of two small groups.
B. Yes. Both Atlanta and New Orleans are large cities, so the salaries are comparable.
C. Yes. Because Atlanta and New Orleans are about 500 miles apart, the two groups of engineers can be assumed to be independent.

**Explanation**

For two random variables \(X\) and \(Y\)

E(X+Y) &= E(X)+E(Y) \\
\operatorname{Var}(X+Y) &= \operatorname{Var}(X)+\operatorname{Var}(Y)+2\,\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)

The problem gives

\[
E(X)=312,\;\; \operatorname{Var}(X)=6,\;\; E(Y)=307,\;\; \operatorname{Var}(Y)=8 .

Thus

\[
E(X+Y)=312+307=619 .

A. by blocking on exercise intensity
B. by blocking on sleep length
C. by blocking on cholesterol level
D. by blocking on capsule type
Answer:",by blocking on exercise intensity,"**Answer: A. By blocking on exercise intensity.**

**Explanation**

- **Exercise intensity** has been shown in past studies to be associated with cholesterol level. If the experiment were run without controlling for this factor, differences in exercise intensity among subjects could confound the comparison between fish‑oil and garlic capsules. Blocking on exercise intensity (e.g., low, moderate, high) ensures that each treatment group has a balanced representation of each intensity level, thereby reducing variability due to this known predictor.

- **Sleep length** is reported to have no association with cholesterol level, so blocking on it would add unnecessary complexity without improving the experiment’s precision.

- **Cholesterol level** is the outcome variable; blocking on it would be inappropriate (you cannot block on the response you are measuring).

- **Capsule type** is the experimental factor you want to compare, so it should not be used for blocking.

A. I only
B. II only
C. III only
D. I and II
Answer:",I and II,"**Answer: D – I and II**

**Why?**

- **Power** is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis, i.e.,
  \[
  \text{Power} = 1 - \beta
  \]
  where \(\beta\) is the probability of a Type II error.

| Change | Effect on Power | Explanation |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Increase sample size (I)** | **Increases power** | A larger sample reduces sampling variability (larger \(n\) → smaller standard error). This sharpens the sampling distribution under the alternative, making it easier to detect a true effect. |
| **Increase significance level \(\alpha\) (II)** | **Increases power** | Raising \(\alpha\) widens the critical region, so the test is more likely to reject \(H_0\) when \(H_1\) is true. This reduces \(\beta\), thus raising power. |
| **Increase probability of a Type II error (III)** | **Decreases power** | By definition, \(\text{Power} = 1 - \beta\). If \(\beta\) rises, power falls. |

Hence, only the first two options increase the test’s power.",1.0

\boxed{0.30}
\]

**Solution**

Let

- \(A\) = “Alfred asks Charlene”, \(P(A)=0.60\)
- \(B\) = “Ben asks Charlene”, \(P(B)=?\)

We are given

- \(P(A\cup B)=0.72\) (at least one asks)
- \(P(A\cap B)=0.18\) (both ask)

Using the inclusion–exclusion formula:

\[
P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)
\]

Plugging in the known values:

\[
0.72 = 0.60 + P(B) - 0.18
\]

\[
0.72 = 0.42 + P(B)
\]

\[
P(B) = 0.72 - 0.42 = 0.30

Hence, the probability that Ben asks Charlene to the prom is **0.30**, which corresponds to choice **B**.",1.0

The two‑proportion z‑test requires that, in each sample, the expected number of successes and the expected number of failures are both at least 5 (so that the sampling distribution of the proportion is approximately normal).

A. For every year the car gets older, the selling price goes down by approximately 9.83 percent.

Answer:","For every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $983.","**Answer: D.**

The regression equation is expressed in units of $1,000.
- The intercept 15.9 means a brand‑new car (age = 0) sells for about **$15,900**.

C. 75 - 0.4756(14)
D. 75 - 0.5244(14)
Answer:",75 - 0.5244(14),"**Answer: D**

Because 30 % of the people live longer than 75 years, 70 % live 75 years or less.

\[
P(X\le 75)=0.70
\]

Let \(Z=\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\) with \(\sigma = 14\).
Then

\[
P\!\left(Z\le \frac{75-\mu}{14}\right)=0.70
\]

The 70th percentile of the standard normal distribution is

\[
z_{0.70}\approx 0.5244

Thus

\[
\frac{75-\mu}{14}=0.5244\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
75-\mu=0.5244\times 14\quad\Longrightarrow\quad

A. 0.42
B. 0.5
C. 0.7
D. 0.833
Answer:",0.833,"**Answer: D. 0.833**

*Explanation*:
Let \(O\) be “customer requests an oil change” and \(T\) be “customer requests a tire replacement.”
We have
- \(P(O) = 0.60\)
- \(P(T) = 0.30\)
- \(P(O \cap T) = 0.10\)

The probability that a customer who requests an oil change **does not** request a tire replacement is

\[
P(\text{not }T \mid O) = \frac{P(O \cap \text{not }T)}{P(O)}.
\]

But
\[
P(O \cap \text{not }T) = P(O) - P(O \cap T) = 0.60 - 0.10 = 0.50.
