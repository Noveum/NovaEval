    "content": "Evals for AI Agents: What They Are, Why They Matter, and How Noveum.ai Makes Them Practical\nAditi Upaddhyay\n9/25/2025\nIf you’ve ever shipped an AI agent, you’ve probably felt this: it works great in your dev sandbox, but the moment it meets real users, things get messy. Suddenly, your “reliable” agent is skipping steps, hallucinating facts, or taking 20 seconds to do something simple.\nThat’s where evals come in. They’re not about passing or failing in the old-school software sense—they’re about continuously measuring whether your agent is doing the job you hired it for.\nIn this blog, we’ll cover:\n- What evals for AI agents actually mean.\n- Why they’re a must-have (not a “nice-to-have”).\n- How Noveum.ai helps you run evals without slowing down your roadmap.\nLet’s dive in.\n1. What are Evals for AI Agents?\nThink of evals as health check-ups for your AI agents. Just like you wouldn’t assume you’re healthy without getting your vitals checked, you shouldn’t assume your agent is “good enough” without running evals.\nIn plain terms\nEvals are structured tests that tell you:\n- Did the agent do what it was supposed to?\n- How well did it do it?\n- Was it safe, accurate, and efficient?\nUnlike traditional QA, which looks for bugs, evals look for quality signals—correctness, completeness, tone, safety, cost, and speed.\nTypes of evals you’ll hear about\n- Offline evals - Run before release, on a fixed dataset. Great for testing prompts or comparing models.\n- Online evals - Run in production on real traffic. Crucial for catching drift, edge cases, and \"silent failures.\"\n- End-to-end evals - Test an entire workflow, not just one answer.\n- Span-level evals - Check each step in the trace—retrieval, reasoning, tool calls.\n- Safety evals - Spot harmful, biased, or policy-violating answers.\nScoring methods\n- Exact matches for structured answers.\n- Rubrics for tone and reasoning.\n- Panel of LLMs (multiple judges instead of one) to cut down bias.\n- Cost + latency tracking side by side with accuracy.\n👉 In short: evals give you visibility. Without them, you’re just trusting your gut.\n2. Why are Evals Necessary for AI Agents?\nLet’s be blunt: AI agents don’t crash with an error message. They fail quietly.\n- A travel booking agent might “forget” a step in the workflow.\n- A fintech agent might miscalculate fees.\n- A support agent might confidently tell a customer something false.\nThese failures don’t show up in logs—they show up in churn, complaints, and unexpected cloud bills.\nReal-world challenges evals solve\n- Data drift: Users change how they ask questions. Models can degrade over time.\n- Messy inputs: People paste screenshots, slang, typos—stuff you never tested for.\n- Hidden costs: A prompt tweak that looks harmless can double your token spend.\n- Compliance needs: For sensitive domains, you need proof your system is safe.\nThe balance every team faces\nYou want your agent to be:\n- Accurate (so users trust it),\n- Fast (so they don’t drop off),\n- Affordable (so margins stay healthy).\nWithout evals, you’re flying blind on all three.\nThat’s why leading teams now treat evals like CI/CD for AI. Every prompt, model, or tool change gets tested against baselines before going live.\n3. How Noveum.ai Helps You Run Evals (Without the Headache)\nYou could build an eval system yourself. Many teams try. Most underestimate the complexity: trace capture, scoring frameworks, dashboards, alerts, model-judge orchestration, drift detection…the list goes on.\nNoveum.ai was built to solve this problem end-to-end.\nSee exactly what your agent is doing (NovaTrace SDK)\n- Instrument once, capture everything: inputs, outputs, tokens, latency, tool calls.\n- Visualize every trace as a flow chart—see where it struggled or wasted time.\n- Span-level clarity: you don’t just see that it failed, you see why.\nScore with fairness and depth (NovaEval)\n- Panel-of-LLMs (patent pending): multiple judges reduce bias.\n- Pre-built scorers: ExactMatch, F1, RAG relevance, Safety.\n- Custom rubrics: Define “good” in your domain (finance ≠ healthcare).\n- Mix human review where it matters most.\nTest like you deploy\n- Offline evals for prompt/model experiments.\n- Shadow or canary live traffic to catch issues before full rollout.\n- A/B test prompts, retrieval configs, or model swaps with dashboards that track accuracy + cost + latency.\nOperate with confidence\n- Set thresholds (e.g., accuracy ≥85%, p95 latency <2s, cost <X).\n- Get alerts in Slack/Email when metrics drift.\n- Versioned baselines so you never ship a regression by accident.\n- Suggestions on next steps (optimize prompt, use smaller model for easy cases, add safety guardrails).\nBuilt for scale\n- Multi-agent workflows? Handled.\n- Retrieval-heavy RAG agents? Scored at context level.\n- On-prem or cloud? Your choice.\n- Security-first, enterprise-ready.\nWhat a Good Evals Workflow Looks Like\n- Capture traces with NovaTrace.\n- Start small: 20–50 examples, basic rubrics.\n- Run offline evals to pick your baseline.\n- Ship to 5% canary traffic, score live samples.\n- Set alerts for dips in accuracy, spikes in cost, or unsafe answers.\n- Review dashboards weekly. Keep improving.\n- Expand eval sets as you hit new edge cases.\nThe result? You stop firefighting. You ship faster. And your AI agents earn trust instead of losing it.\nWhy Teams Pick Noveum.ai\n- Faster time-to-value - No need to reinvent tracing + eval infra.\n- More reliable signal - Panel-of-LLMs > single-judge bias.\n- Production-first - Canary + shadow testing keep evals alive after launch.\n- Actionable insights - Not just charts—concrete next steps.\n- Scales with your roadmap - From one agent to many, from single prompt to multi-agent orchestration.\nFinal Thoughts\nAI agents are powerful, but they’re unpredictable without the right checks in place. Evals are how you turn that unpredictability into measurable, improvable performance.\nAt Noveum.ai, we’re not just giving you dashboards. We’re giving you a system that helps your agents get better week after week—automatically.\nIf you’re serious about shipping reliable AI agents, it’s time to put evals at the center of your workflow.\n👉 Contact our cofounder at [email protected] or book a call here: https://calendly.com/aditi-noveum\nGet Early Access to Noveum.ai Platform\nJoin the select group of AI teams optimizing their models with our data-driven platform.

    "content": "From Development to Production - Inside Noveum.ai's AI Observability Platform\nShashank Agarwal\n3/3/2025\nIntroduction\nEvery AI application tells a story—but most developers never get to hear it. When your RAG pipeline returns irrelevant results, when your multi-agent system gets stuck in loops, or when your LLM costs suddenly spike, you're left guessing what went wrong and where.\nThat's exactly the challenge Noveum.ai solves. Rather than flying blind, our platform provides comprehensive tracing and observability specifically designed for AI applications. Whether you're building LLM-powered chatbots, RAG systems, or complex multi-agent workflows, Noveum.ai gives you the insights you need to understand, debug, and optimize your AI applications.\nThe AI Observability Challenge\nWhy Traditional Monitoring Falls Short\nTraditional application monitoring tools weren't built for AI applications. They can tell you if your API is responding, but they can't answer the questions that matter most for AI systems:\n- Why did my RAG pipeline retrieve irrelevant documents?\n- Which LLM calls are driving my costs?\n- How are my agents communicating with each other?\n- What's causing hallucinations in my responses?\n- Why is my embedding generation so slow?\nWhat Makes AI Applications Different\nAI applications have unique characteristics that require specialized observability:\n- 🧠 Context Flow: Data flows through embeddings, retrievals, and generations\n- 💰 Variable Costs: Token usage creates unpredictable expenses\n- 🔀 Complex Workflows: Multi-step pipelines with branching logic\n- 🤖 Agent Interactions: Multiple AI entities coordinating tasks\n- 📊 Quality Metrics: Success isn't just about uptime—it's about output quality\nStep 1: SDK Integration\nEffortless Instrumentation\nAt the heart of Noveum.ai are our Python and TypeScript SDKs that integrate seamlessly into your existing codebase. With just a few lines of code, you can start capturing comprehensive traces of your AI operations.\nimport noveum_trace\n# Initialize once at startup\nnoveum_trace.init(\napi_key=\"your-api-key\",\nproject=\"customer-support-bot\",\nenvironment=\"production\"\n)\n# Trace LLM calls automatically\n@noveum_trace.trace_llm\ndef generate_response(user_question: str) -> str:\nreturn openai.chat.completions.create(\nmodel=\"gpt-4\",\nmessages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_question}]\n).choices[0].message.content\nWhat Gets Captured Automatically\nOnce integrated, Noveum.ai automatically captures:\n- 🔍 Request/Response Data: Inputs, outputs, and transformations\n- ⏱️ Performance Metrics: Latency, throughput, and bottlenecks\n- 💰 Cost Tracking: Token usage and API costs across providers\n- 🏷️ Rich Metadata: Model parameters, user context, and custom attributes\n- 🌊 Context Flow: How data moves through your AI pipeline\n- 🐛 Error Details: Stack traces and failure analysis\nStep 2: Understanding Your AI Workflows\nRAG Pipeline Visibility\nRAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems involve multiple complex steps. Noveum.ai traces each phase, giving you complete visibility:\n@noveum_trace.trace(\"rag-pipeline\")\ndef answer_customer_question(question: str) -> str:\n# Phase 1: Query understanding\nwith noveum_trace.trace_step(\"query-analysis\") as step:\nintent = analyze_query_intent(question)\nstep.set_attribute(\"query.intent\", intent)\nstep.set_attribute(\"query.complexity\", get_complexity_score(question))\n# Phase 2: Document retrieval\nwith noveum_trace.trace_step(\"document-retrieval\") as step:\nembeddings = generate_embeddings(question)\ndocuments = vector_search(embeddings, k=5)\nstep.set_attribute(\"documents.retrieved\", len(documents))\nstep.set_attribute(\"documents.avg_similarity\", avg_similarity(documents))\nstep.set_attribute(\"retrieval.model\", \"text-embedding-ada-002\")\n# Phase 3: Answer generation\nwith noveum_trace.trace_step(\"answer-generation\") as step:\ncontext = build_context(documents)\nanswer = generate_answer_with_context(question, context)\nstep.set_attribute(\"context.length\", len(context))\nstep.set_attribute(\"answer.confidence\", calculate_confidence(answer))\nstep.set_attribute(\"generation.model\", \"gpt-4\")\nreturn answer\nMulti-Agent Coordination\nWhen multiple AI agents work together, Noveum.ai tracks their interactions and coordination:\nconst multiAgentTask = trace('customer-inquiry-resolution', async (inquiry: string) => {\n// Agent 1: Classification\nconst category = await span('classify-inquiry', async (spanInstance) => {\nspanInstance.setAttribute('agent.name', 'classifier');\nspanInstance.setAttribute('inquiry.length', inquiry.length);\nreturn await classificationAgent.categorize(inquiry);\n});\n// Agent 2: Research (if needed)\nlet context = null;\nif (category.needsResearch) {\ncontext = await span('research-context', async (spanInstance) => {\nspanInstance.setAttribute('agent.name', 'researcher');\nspanInstance.setAttribute('research.category', category.type);\nreturn await researchAgent.gatherContext(inquiry);\n});\n}\n// Agent 3: Response generation\nconst response = await span('generate-response', async (spanInstance) => {\nspanInstance.setAttribute('agent.name', 'responder');\nspanInstance.setAttribute('response.has_context', !!context);\nreturn await responseAgent.generate(inquiry, context);\n});\nreturn response;\n});\nStep 3: Real-Time Debugging and Optimization\nPerformance Bottleneck Identification\nNoveum.ai's dashboard automatically identifies performance issues:\n- 🐌 Slow Operations: Which LLM calls or embeddings are taking too long?\n- 🔄 Redundant Processing: Are you generating the same embeddings multiple times?\n- 📊 Resource Usage: Which operations consume the most tokens or memory?\n- 🚨 Error Patterns: What types of failures occur most frequently?\nCost Optimization Insights\nWith detailed cost tracking, you can optimize your AI spending:\n- Provider Comparison: See actual costs across OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.\n- Model Analysis: Compare performance vs. cost for different models\n- Usage Patterns: Identify expensive operations and optimize them\n- Budget Alerts: Get notified when costs exceed thresholds\nQuality Assurance\nBeyond performance, Noveum.ai helps ensure output quality:\n- Response Analysis: Track confidence scores and quality metrics\n- A/B Testing: Compare different models or prompts\n- User Feedback: Correlate user satisfaction with trace data\n- Drift Detection: Identify when model performance degrades\nReal-World Example: Customer Support Bot\nLet's walk through a real example.

different LLMs on real production traffic\n- Optimize Prompts: See which prompts perform best for different use cases\n- Reduce Costs: Identify expensive operations and optimize them\n- Improve Quality: Monitor output quality and user satisfaction\n- Scale Confidently: Understand system behavior under load\nReal-World Example: RAG-Powered Customer Support\nImagine you're building an AI-powered customer support system with a RAG pipeline:\n- User Query: Customer asks about pricing\n- Document Retrieval: System searches knowledge base\n- Context Preparation: Relevant documents are processed\n- LLM Generation: GPT-4 generates response with context\n- Response Delivery: Answer is sent to customer\nWithout Noveum.ai: When the system gives wrong answers, you have no visibility into what went wrong. Was it poor retrieval? Bad context preparation? LLM hallucination?\nWith Noveum.ai: Every step is traced:\n@noveum_trace.trace\ndef handle_support_query(user_query: str, user_id: str) -> str:\n# Each step is automatically traced\n# Step 1: Query analysis\nquery_intent = analyze_query_intent(user_query)\n# Step 2: Document retrieval\nrelevant_docs = retrieve_documents(user_query, query_intent)\n# Step 3: Context preparation\ncontext = prepare_context(relevant_docs)\n# Step 4: LLM generation\nresponse = generate_response(user_query, context)\n# Step 5: Response validation\nvalidated_response = validate_response(response, user_query)\nreturn validated_response\nNow you can see:\n- Which queries are taking too long (retrieval vs. generation)\n- When retrieval is returning irrelevant documents\n- How much each interaction costs\n- Which responses users rate poorly\n- Complete audit trail for compliance\nAdvanced Features\nMulti-Agent System Observability\n@noveum_trace.trace_agent(agent_id=\"coordinator\")\ndef coordinate_research_project(topic: str) -> dict:\n# Assign tasks to specialist agents\nliterature_review = literature_agent(topic)\ndata_analysis = data_agent(topic)\nsynthesis = synthesis_agent(literature_review, data_analysis)\nreturn {\n\"literature\": literature_review,\n\"analysis\": data_analysis,\n\"synthesis\": synthesis\n}\nCustom Sampling and Filtering\nnoveum_trace.init(\napi_key=\"your-key\",\nproject=\"my-project\",\ntransport_config={\n\"sample_rate\": 0.1, # Sample 10% of traces\n\"capture_errors\": True, # Always capture errors\n\"capture_stack_traces\": False # Skip stack traces for performance\n}\n)\nContext Propagation\n// Automatic context propagation across async operations\nconst contextManager = getGlobalContextManager();\nawait contextManager.withSpan(span, async () => {\n// This function runs with span in context\nawait someNestedOperation();\n});\nWhy Choose Noveum.ai?\n- AI-Native Design: Built specifically for LLM applications, not generic APM tools\n- Easy Integration: Minutes to get started, not days of configuration\n- Framework Agnostic: Works with any LLM provider, vector database, or framework\n- Production Ready: Built for scale with intelligent sampling and batching\n- Privacy Focused: You control what data is captured and how it's stored\n- Open Source SDKs: Transparent, auditable, and extensible\nGetting Started\nReady to add comprehensive observability to your AI applications?\n- Sign up at noveum.ai\n- Create a project and get your API key\n- Install the SDK for your preferred language\n- Add tracing to your AI workflows\n- Explore insights in the Noveum.ai dashboard\nCheck out our integration guide for detailed setup instructions and examples.\nWrapping Up\nNoveum.ai brings the observability your AI applications deserve.

    "content": "Tracing Concepts for AI Applications\nUnderstanding traces, spans, and observability fundamentals for LLM applications, RAG systems, and AI agents\nUnderstanding the fundamentals of tracing is essential for getting the most out of Noveum.ai. This guide explains key concepts specifically in the context of AI applications, helping you design effective observability strategies for your LLM applications, RAG systems, and AI agents.\n🎯 What is Tracing?\nTracing is the practice of tracking requests as they flow through your system, creating a detailed map of what happened, when, and how long each operation took. For AI applications, tracing provides crucial insights into:\n- 🔍 Request Flow: How user queries move through your AI pipeline\n- ⏱️ Performance: Where time is spent in your AI operations\n- 💰 Costs: Which operations drive your AI spending\n- 🐛 Debugging: What went wrong when errors occur\n- 📊 Quality: How well your AI system is performing\n🌟 Core Concepts\n1. Traces\nA trace represents a single journey through your system—like a user asking a question and getting an answer. Think of it as the complete story of one request.\nTrace Characteristics:\n- 🆔 Unique ID: Every trace has a unique identifier\n- ⏰ Timeline: Start and end timestamps\n- 🌐 Distributed: Can span multiple services\n- 📊 Hierarchical: Contains multiple related spans\n2. Spans\nA span represents a single operation within a trace. Each span has a clear start and end time and represents work being done.\nSpan Characteristics:\n- 📛 Name: Descriptive name of the operation\n- ⏱️ Duration: How long the operation took\n- 👥 Parent-Child: Spans can contain other spans\n- 🏷️ Attributes: Key-value metadata about the operation\n- 📝 Events: Point-in-time occurrences during the span\n3. Attributes\nAttributes are key-value pairs that provide context about what happened during a span. They're crucial for understanding and filtering your traces.\nCommon AI Attribute Categories:\n- 🤖 LLM Attributes:\nllm.model\n,llm.provider\n,llm.temperature\n- 💰 Cost Attributes:\nllm.tokens.input\n,llm.tokens.output\n,llm.cost\n- 👤 User Attributes:\nuser.id\n,user.plan\n,user.location\n- 📄 Content Attributes:\nprompt.length\n,response.length\n,content.type\n- 🔍 Quality Attributes:\nrelevance.score\n,confidence.level\n,accuracy.rating\n4. Events\nEvents represent things that happened at a specific point in time during a span. They're perfect for capturing important moments or milestones.\n🧠 AI-Specific Tracing Patterns\nRAG Pipeline Tracing\nRAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems have distinct phases that should be traced separately:\nMulti-Agent Tracing\nWhen dealing with multiple AI agents, trace their interactions and coordination:\n📊 Observability Best Practices\n1. Meaningful Span Names\nUse descriptive, consistent naming conventions:\n2. Rich Attributes\nInclude context that helps with debugging and analysis:\n3. Error Handling\nAlways capture error details:\n4. Performance Context\nInclude performance-relevant attributes:\n🔍 Using Traces for Debugging\nCommon Debugging Scenarios\n1. Slow Response Times\n2. High Costs\n3. Quality Issues\n4. Error Patterns\n🎯 Next Steps\nNow that you understand tracing concepts, you're ready to:\n- Implement SDK Integration - Add tracing to your application\n- Explore Framework Integrations - Framework-specific guidance\n- Learn Advanced Patterns - Custom instrumentation techniques\n- Master the Dashboard - Analyze your traces effectively\nRemember: Good observability is not about collecting all possible data, but about collecting the right data that helps you understand, debug, and optimize your AI applications.\nGet Early Access to Noveum.ai Platform\nBe the first one to get notified when we open Noveum Platform to more users.

    "content": "Tracing Concepts for AI Applications\nUnderstanding traces, spans, and observability fundamentals for LLM applications, RAG systems, and AI agents\nUnderstanding the fundamentals of tracing is essential for getting the most out of Noveum.ai. This guide explains key concepts specifically in the context of AI applications, helping you design effective observability strategies for your LLM applications, RAG systems, and AI agents.\n🎯 What is Tracing?\nTracing is the practice of tracking requests as they flow through your system, creating a detailed map of what happened, when, and how long each operation took. For AI applications, tracing provides crucial insights into:\n- 🔍 Request Flow: How user queries move through your AI pipeline\n- ⏱️ Performance: Where time is spent in your AI operations\n- 💰 Costs: Which operations drive your AI spending\n- 🐛 Debugging: What went wrong when errors occur\n- 📊 Quality: How well your AI system is performing\n🌟 Core Concepts\n1. Traces\nA trace represents a single journey through your system—like a user asking a question and getting an answer. Think of it as the complete story of one request.\nTrace Characteristics:\n- 🆔 Unique ID: Every trace has a unique identifier\n- ⏰ Timeline: Start and end timestamps\n- 🌐 Distributed: Can span multiple services\n- 📊 Hierarchical: Contains multiple related spans\n2. Spans\nA span represents a single operation within a trace. Each span has a clear start and end time and represents work being done.\nSpan Characteristics:\n- 📛 Name: Descriptive name of the operation\n- ⏱️ Duration: How long the operation took\n- 👥 Parent-Child: Spans can contain other spans\n- 🏷️ Attributes: Key-value metadata about the operation\n- 📝 Events: Point-in-time occurrences during the span\n3. Attributes\nAttributes are key-value pairs that provide context about what happened during a span. They're crucial for understanding and filtering your traces.\nCommon AI Attribute Categories:\n- 🤖 LLM Attributes:\nllm.model\n,llm.provider\n,llm.temperature\n- 💰 Cost Attributes:\nllm.tokens.input\n,llm.tokens.output\n,llm.cost\n- 👤 User Attributes:\nuser.id\n,user.plan\n,user.location\n- 📄 Content Attributes:\nprompt.length\n,response.length\n,content.type\n- 🔍 Quality Attributes:\nrelevance.score\n,confidence.level\n,accuracy.rating\n4. Events\nEvents represent things that happened at a specific point in time during a span. They're perfect for capturing important moments or milestones.\n🧠 AI-Specific Tracing Patterns\nRAG Pipeline Tracing\nRAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems have distinct phases that should be traced separately:\nMulti-Agent Tracing\nWhen dealing with multiple AI agents, trace their interactions and coordination:\n📊 Observability Best Practices\n1. Meaningful Span Names\nUse descriptive, consistent naming conventions:\n2. Rich Attributes\nInclude context that helps with debugging and analysis:\n3. Error Handling\nAlways capture error details:\n4. Performance Context\nInclude performance-relevant attributes:\n🔍 Using Traces for Debugging\nCommon Debugging Scenarios\n1. Slow Response Times\n2. High Costs\n3. Quality Issues\n4. Error Patterns\n🎯 Next Steps\nNow that you understand tracing concepts, you're ready to:\n- Implement SDK Integration - Add tracing to your application\n- Explore Framework Integrations - Framework-specific guidance\n- Learn Advanced Patterns - Custom instrumentation techniques\n- Master the Dashboard - Analyze your traces effectively\nRemember: Good observability is not about collecting all possible data, but about collecting the right data that helps you understand, debug, and optimize your AI applications.\nGet Early Access to Noveum.ai Platform\nBe the first one to get notified when we open Noveum Platform to more users.
