Fifteen engineers work in the Atlanta office, and 14 engineers work in the New Orleans office. The business manager decided to use a 2-sample t-test to compare the mean salaries of engineers in the two offices. Because there were only 15 engineers in one office and 14 engineers in the other, he used the salaries of all the engineers in the computation. Is the 2-sample t-test an appropriate inferential technique in this situation?
A. Yes, because he is comparing the means of two small groups.
B. Yes. Both Atlanta and New Orleans are large cities, so the salaries are comparable.
C. Yes. Because Atlanta and New Orleans are about 500 miles apart, the two groups of engineers can be assumed to be independent.
D. No, because the entire population information was used from both offices. Because no samples were taken, a t-test should not be used.

Because the manager used the salaries of **all** engineers in each office (the entire population of interest), there is no sampling variability to estimate. The 2‑sample t‑test is a tool for inferential statistics when you have a *sample* drawn from a larger population.

To estimate the total stock investment by students in this school, two plans are proposed. Plan I would sample 30 students at random, find a confidence interval estimate of their average investment, and then multiply both ends of this interval by 1650 to get an interval estimate of the total investment. Plan II would sample 30 students at random from among the 132 who have investments in the market, find a confidence interval estimate of their average investment, and then multiply both ends of this interval by 132 to get an interval estimate of the total investment. Which is the better plan for estimating the total stock market investment by students in this school?
A. Plan I
B. Plan II
C. Both plans use random samples and so will produce equivalent results.
D. Neither plan will give an accurate estimate.
Answer:",Plan II,"**Answer: B – Plan II is the better plan.**

**Why?**

The goal is to estimate the *total* stock‑investment of the 1,650 students.
Only 132 of those students actually have investments; the other 1,518 have an investment of $0. Thus the total sum of investments in the whole school is the same as the sum of investments of the 132 investors.

---

### Plan I
- Randomly samples 30 students from the entire 1,650.
- Computes the sample mean \( \bar{Y}_I \) of the *whole* population (which includes many zeros).
- Estimates the total as \( \hat{T}_I = 1650\,\bar{Y}_I \).

Because the sample mean is taken from a population that contains a large proportion of zeros, the sample variance of \( \bar{Y}_I \) is relatively large. Consequently, the confidence interval for \( \hat{T}_I \) is wide.

---

### Plan II
- Randomly samples 30 students *only from the 132 investors*.
- Computes the sample mean \( \bar{Y}_{II} \) of the investors (there are no zeros in this sub‑sample).
- Estimates the total as \( \hat{T}_{II}=132\,\bar{Y}_{II} \).

Since the sub‑population has no zero observations, its variance is smaller. The standard error of \( \bar{Y}_{II} \) is therefore smaller, and after multiplying by 132 the resulting confidence interval for the total is narrower than that obtained with Plan I.

---

### Variance comparison (illustrative)

\[
\operatorname{Var}(\hat{T}_I)=1650^2\,\frac{\sigma_Y^2(1-30/1650)}{30},\qquad
\operatorname{Var}(\hat{T}_{II})=132^2\,\frac{\sigma_{\text{inv}}^2(1-30/132)}{30},
\]

where \(\sigma_Y^2\) is the variance of investment for the whole school and \(\sigma_{\text{inv}}^2\) is the variance among investors.
Because zeros inflate \(\sigma_Y^2\) relative to \(\sigma_{\text{inv}}^2\), \(\operatorname{Var}(\hat{T}_{II})\) is usually much smaller than \(\operatorname{Var}(\hat{T}_I)\).

---

Therefore Plan II provides a more precise (narrower confidence interval) and thus a better estimate of the total stock‑market investment of the school’s students.

A. 0.8333
B. 0.1667
C. 0.9869
D. 0.0132
Answer:",0.0132,"The bakery will run out of bread if the daily demand exceeds the 3,000 loaves baked.

The daily demand \(D\) is normally distributed:

\[
D \sim N(\mu = 2500,\;\sigma = 225)
\]

We need \(P(D > 3000)\).

1. **Standardize the value 3000**

\[
z = \frac{3000 - \mu}{\sigma}
  = \frac{3000 - 2500}{225}
  = \frac{500}{225}
  \approx 2.22
\]

2. **Find the tail probability**

For a standard normal variable \(Z\),

\[
P(D > 3000) = P(Z > 2.22)
\]

Using the standard normal table (or a calculator):

\[
\Phi(2.22) \approx 0.9869
\]

Hence

\[
P(Z > 2.22) = 1 - \Phi(2.22) \approx 1 - 0.9869 = 0.0131

The exact probability depends on the actual size of the jury pool. Without knowing how many potential jurors are in the pool (and hence how many women it contains), we cannot compute the precise probability that a randomly chosen 12‑person jury will contain at least three women. In a large pool the binomial approximation \(1-\left(P(0)+P(1)+P(2)\right)\) would give about \(0.75\), but the true value could differ if the pool is small.

A. I only

**Why?**

- **Power** of a test = \(1-\beta\) (the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis).
- **(I) Increasing the sample size**: With more data the sampling distribution becomes tighter, making it easier to detect a true effect → \( \beta\) decreases, so power increases.
- **(II) Increasing the significance level (\(\alpha\))**: A higher \(\alpha\) widens the critical region, giving the test a higher chance of rejecting \(H_0\) when it is false → \( \beta\) decreases, so power increases.
- **(III) Increasing the probability of a Type II error (\(\beta\))**: This directly **decreases** power, because power = \(1-\beta\).

D. The shapes of the population distributions are not known.
Answer:",The number of successes and the number of failures for the two groups are not all large enough.,"**Answer: C.**

For a two‑proportion z‑test the usual normal approximation requires that both \(n p\) and \(n(1-p)\) be at least about 10 for each group.

- Females: \(n=70,\; \hat p=66/70=0.943\) → \(np=66\) (ok) but \(n(1-p)=4\) (not ≥10).
- Males: \(n=60,\; \hat p=50/60=0.833\) → \(np=50\) and \(n(1-p)=10\) (just meets the rule).

Because the number of failures for the female group (4) is less than 10, the normal approximation underlying the two‑proportion z‑test is not justified. The other options (different sample sizes, large sample sizes, unknown population shapes) are not reasons for the test’s inappropriateness.",1.0

Answer:","For every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $983.","The regression equation is written in **thousands of dollars**:

\[
