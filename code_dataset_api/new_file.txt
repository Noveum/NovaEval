It is a fundamental, all-pervading, all-penetrating, and all-permeating substance that is believed to be the unifying factor that holds the Universe together. It is thought to permeate both space and time and to be the medium through which light propagates.\nWhat evidence is there for the aether?\nThere is no direct evidence for the existence of the aether. However, many theories and experiments suggest its existence. For example, the Michelson-Morley experiment, which was designed to detect the effect of the aether on the light velocity in different directions, did not detect any effect, which led to the conclusion that the aether probably doesn't exist. This experiment has since been tested repeatedly and has not returned any evidence of the aether.\nHowever, there are some indirect pieces of evidence that suggest the aether may exist. For example, the fact that the Universe is expanding faster than the speed of light suggests that the aether must be a fundamentally different type of substance that does not obey the same rules of physics as normal matter. Additionally, the Big Bang theory suggests",
